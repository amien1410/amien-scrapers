Response formatting (can format the API response in JSON etc.) 2.) Environment setup (I can create and switch to a new environment which is very helpful to test the API response either in Quality or Production) 3.) I can easily get the code snippets for the provided API integration in the desired coding language, which is very helpful and time saving. 4.) I can also create my team, where all the members can perform testing simultaneously.\\n\\nWhat do you dislike about Postman?\\nThere is not much to dislike in Postman, but few are: 1.) I can add only limited member in a team with a basic/free plan. 2.) Sometimes, I get 429 for repeated API calls. 3.) Sometimes I also feel like Postman should also allow the user to manage workspace as code blocks rather limiting it to endpoints only.\\n\\nWhat problems is Postman solving and how is that benefiting you?\\nIt provides various features that solve common problems faced during API development and interaction:\\n1.) Simplifies API Testing and Debugging : Simplifies API testing by providing a visual interface for interacting with APIs, making it easy for developers and testers to debug requests and responses.\\n2.) Collaborative API Development :  Increases productivity by providing a shared environment for developers, testers, and stakeholders to collaborate on APIs.\\n3.) Comprehensive API Documentation :  Saves time by generating real-time documentation and provides a clear reference for developers using or consuming the API.',\n",

I can also create my team, where all the members can perform testing simultaneously.\\n\\nWhat do you dislike about Postman?\\nThere is not much to dislike in Postman, but few are: 1.) I can add only limited member in a team with a basic/free plan. 2.) Sometimes, I get 429 for repeated API calls. 3.) Sometimes I also feel like Postman should also allow the user to manage workspace as code blocks rather limiting it to endpoints only.\\n\\nWhat problems is Postman solving and how is that benefiting you?\\nIt provides various features that solve common problems faced during API development and interaction:\\n1.) Simplifies API Testing and Debugging : Simplifies API testing by providing a visual interface for interacting with APIs, making it easy for developers and testers to debug requests and responses.\\n2.) Collaborative API Development :  Increases productivity by providing a shared environment for developers, testers, and stakeholders to collaborate on APIs.\\n3.)

It makes it easy for me to create, manage, and run API tests without a steep learning curve. This intuitiveness significantly reduces the time it takes to get started and be productive.\\n\\nRobust Testing Capabilities: Postman provides a comprehensive suite of testing tools. I appreciate the ability to create detailed test cases, run automated tests, and validate API responses with ease. It's a time-saver and ensures the reliability of our APIs.\\n\\nTeam Collaboration: Collaboration is seamless with Postman. The ability to share collections, collaborate on API development, and leave comments on requests fosters effective teamwork. This feature has improved communication within our development team.\\n\\nDocumentation Generation: The ability to generate API documentation from our collections is a standout feature. It helps us maintain well-documented APIs that are accessible to both technical and non-technical team members, making it easier to understand and use our APIs.\\n\\nIntegration Options: Postman integrates seamlessly with our other development tools, such as Jira and GitHub. This integration streamlines our workflow and helps us manage and track API-related tasks more efficiently.\\n\\nOverall, what I like best about Postman is its combination of user-friendliness, powerful testing capabilities, collaborative features, documentation generation, and integration options. It has become an essential tool in our development process, making API testing and development much smoother and more efficient.\\n\\nWhat do you dislike about Postman?\\nWhen discussing what you dislike about Postman in a review or discussion, it's essential to provide constructive feedback. Here's a template for your response:\\n\\nWhat I dislike about Postman is:\\n\\nLearning Curve for Advanced Features: While Postman is generally user-friendly, I've found that some of the more advanced features can be challenging to master. It would be beneficial if there were more accessible resources or tutorials to help users unlock the full potential of these features.\\n\\nCost for Pro and Enterprise Plans: The pricing for the Pro and Enterprise plans can be a bit high, especially for smaller teams or individual developers. While the features they offer are valuable, it may be a barrier for some users. More flexible pricing options or a more affordable tier for small teams would be appreciated.\\n\\nPerformance Issues: Occasionally, I've experienced performance issues when working with very large collections or running extensive test suites. It would be great to see improvements in the platform's performance and resource optimization to handle larger workloads more smoothly.\\n\\nLimited Offline Mode: Postman primarily relies on an internet connection, which can be a limitation when working in environments with unreliable or restricted internet access. An improved offline mode or the ability to cache collections for offline use would be a valuable addition.\\n\\nDocumentation Updates: While Postman does offer documentation, it could benefit from more frequent updates to keep pace with new features and changes in the tool. This would help users stay informed and make the most of Postman's capabilities.\\n\\nIn summary, my dislikes about Postman revolve around the learning curve for advanced features, the pricing structure for Pro and Enterprise plans, occasional performance issues, limited offline functionality, and the need for more up-to-date documentation. These are areas where I believe Postman could make improvements to enhance the user experience further.\\n\\nWhat problems is Postman solving and how is that benefiting you?\\nPostman is solving several key problems for me as a backend developer, and these solutions greatly benefit my workflow and collaboration with the frontend team:\\n\\nStreamlining API Development: Postman simplifies the process of API development by providing a user-friendly interface to design and test APIs. This streamlining of development tasks saves me time and effort, allowing me to focus on creating robust APIs.\\n\\nEffective Communication: Postman acts as a communication bridge between backend and frontend teams. It allows me to share API endpoints, request examples, and documentation in a structured and organized manner. This ensures that both teams are on the same page and reduces the chances of miscommunication.\\n\\nReal-World Testing: Postman enables me to perform real-world testing of APIs by simulating various scenarios, including error and success responses. This ensures that the APIs are thoroughly tested and ready for integration into frontend applications, reducing the likelihood of unexpected issues.\\n\\nCollaborative Feedback: Postman's collaboration features facilitate seamless feedback and collaboration with the frontend team. They can provide comments, suggestions, and insights directly within Postman, leading to faster issue resolution and improved API quality.\\n\\nDocumentation Creation: Postman's ability to generate API documentation is a significant benefit. It allows me to create comprehensive documentation that serves as a reference for the frontend team. This documentation improves the usability of the APIs and reduces the need for constant clarification.\\n\\nIn summary, Postman solves problems related to API development, communication, testing, collaboration, and documentation. These solutions benefit me by making API development more efficient, ensuring effective communication, enhancing testing capabilities, enabling collaborative feedback, and providing comprehensive documentation, ultimately leading to smoother backend-frontend integration.\",\n",

              "    {'question': 'What do you dislike about Postman?',\n",
              "     'answer': \"When discussing what you dislike about Postman in a review or discussion, it's essential to provide constructive feedback. Here's a template for your response:\\n\\nWhat I dislike about Postman is:\\n\\nLearning Curve for Advanced Features: While Postman is generally user-friendly, I've found that some of the more advanced features can be challenging to master. It would be beneficial if there were more accessible resources or tutorials to help users unlock the full potential of these features.\\n\\nCost for Pro and Enterprise Plans: The pricing for the Pro and Enterprise plans can be a bit high, especially for smaller teams or individual developers. While the features they offer are valuable, it may be a barrier for some users. More flexible pricing options or a more affordable tier for small teams would be appreciated.\\n\\nPerformance Issues: Occasionally, I've experienced performance issues when working with very large collections or running extensive test suites. It would be great to see improvements in the platform's performance and resource optimization to handle larger workloads more smoothly.\\n\\nLimited Offline Mode: Postman primarily relies on an internet connection, which can be a limitation when working in environments with unreliable or restricted internet access. An improved offline mode or the ability to cache collections for offline use would be a valuable addition.\\n\\nDocumentation Updates: While Postman does offer documentation, it could benefit from more frequent updates to keep pace with new features and changes in the tool. This would help users stay informed and make the most of Postman's capabilities.\\n\\nIn summary, my dislikes about Postman revolve around the learning curve for advanced features, the pricing structure for Pro and Enterprise plans, occasional performance issues, limited offline functionality, and the need for more up-to-date documentation. These are areas where I believe Postman could make improvements to enhance the user experience further.\"},\n",
              "    {'question': 'What problems is Postman solving and how is that benefiting you?',\n",
              "     'answer': \"Postman is solving several key problems for me as a backend developer, and these solutions greatly benefit my workflow and collaboration with the frontend team:\\n\\nStreamlining API Development: Postman simplifies the process of API development by providing a user-friendly interface to design and test APIs. This streamlining of development tasks saves me time and effort, allowing me to focus on creating robust APIs.\\n\\nEffective Communication: Postman acts as a communication bridge between backend and frontend teams. It allows me to share API endpoints, request examples, and documentation in a structured and organized manner. This ensures that both teams are on the same page and reduces the chances of miscommunication.\\n\\nReal-World Testing: Postman enables me to perform real-world testing of APIs by simulating various scenarios, including error and success responses. This ensures that the APIs are thoroughly tested and ready for integration into frontend applications, reducing the likelihood of unexpected issues.\\n\\nCollaborative Feedback: Postman's collaboration features facilitate seamless feedback and collaboration with the frontend team. They can provide comments, suggestions, and insights directly within Postman, leading to faster issue resolution and improved API quality.\\n\\nDocumentation Creation: Postman's ability to generate API documentation is a significant benefit. It allows me to create comprehensive documentation that serves as a reference for the frontend team. This documentation improves the usability of the APIs and reduces the need for constant clarification.\\n\\nIn summary, Postman solves problems related to API development, communication, testing, collaboration, and documentation. These solutions benefit me by making API development more efficient, ensuring effective communication, enhancing testing capabilities, enabling collaborative feedback, and providing comprehensive documentation, ultimately leading to smoother backend-frontend integration.\"}],\n",

You can try it too quickly.  Setting up a front-end app in my daily job is quite cumbersome; it usually takes longer. So when there is a bug, I just hit APIs to my server from Postman, which significantly saves my time.\"}],\n",

This extensibility enhances productivity and extends the functionality of the tool to suit specific project requirements.\\n\\nWhat do you dislike about Postman?\\nWhile Postman offers a rich set of features, there are a few areas that could be improved. One aspect that can be challenging at times is the learning curve associated with more advanced features and functionalities. Although the tool provides comprehensive documentation and a helpful community, some features, such as writing complex tests or utilizing advanced authentication mechanisms, may require additional learning and experimentation.\\nAnother area that can be improved is the performance of Postman when working with large collections or executing numerous requests. Occasionally, there can be slight delays or lag when dealing with complex API scenarios, but it's worth noting that this mostly occurs in resource-intensive operations and does not significantly impact the overall experience.\\n\\nLastly, while Postman offers a free version with robust functionality, some advanced features, such as team collaboration and more extensive reporting, are only available in the paid plans. While understandable from a business perspective, it might limit access to those features for individuals or small teams with budget constraints.\\n\\nOverall, Postman is an exceptional tool for API development and testing, providing a user-friendly interface, powerful request-building capabilities, and extensive testing features. Despite a slight learning curve for advanced features, occasional performance considerations, and limitations in the free version, Postman remains an indispensable tool for developers and testers alike, streamlining workflows and ensuring efficient API development and testing processes.\\n\\nWhat problems is Postman solving and how is that benefiting you?\\nPostman solves several problems in API development and testing, and its benefits are significant for developers. Here are some key problems that Postman addresses and how it benefits me:\\n\\nStreamlining API Testing: Postman simplifies the process of testing APIs by providing a user-friendly interface and powerful testing capabilities. It allows me to create and send HTTP requests with ease, customize headers, query parameters, and request bodies effortlessly. The ability to automate the testing process using JavaScript-based syntax helps ensure the correctness and reliability of APIs. Postman's comprehensive logging and debugging tools further aid in identifying and resolving issues during testing, saving valuable time and effort.\\n\\nSimplified API Documentation: Documenting APIs accurately and comprehensively can be a challenge.

With the ability to import and export collections, multiple developers can work on the same API simultaneously and share their work effortlessly. This streamlines the development process, encourages collaboration, and ensures consistency across the team.\\n\\nTest Automation and Continuous Integration: Postman integrates well with continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipelines. It allows for the creation of test suites that can be run automatically during the build and deployment process. By integrating Postman into the CI/CD workflow, I can catch API issues early, ensure that changes to the API don't break existing functionality, and maintain the quality and reliability of the API over time.\\n\\nExtensibility and Integration: Postman offers an extensive marketplace of integrations and plugins, providing the ability to extend its functionality and integrate with other tools and services. This allows me to enhance my workflow by integrating Postman with tools like source control systems, test automation frameworks, and monitoring services. These integrations make it easier to incorporate Postman into existing development processes and leverage additional features and capabilities.\\n\\nBy addressing these problems, Postman significantly benefits me as a developer. It saves time and effort in testing and documenting APIs, facilitates collaboration among team members, enables test automation in CI/CD pipelines, and provides the flexibility to integrate with other tools. Overall, Postman enhances efficiency, improves the quality of APIs, and streamlines the entire API development and testing workflow.\",\n",

              "   'review_content': \"What do you like best about Postman?\\nOne of Postman's distinguishing qualities is its user-friendly design, which makes it incredibly simple to use and navigate. The application's clean, user-friendly style welcomes you immediately and makes it simple to develop, maintain, and test APIs. Postman's UI's ease of use and effectiveness substantially increase productivity and speed up the API development process, whether you're a novice or a seasoned developer. You can rapidly access and edit various request types, headers, parameters, and authentication methods thanks to the clearly labelled tabs and simple menus, ensuring that you may efficiently interact with APIs in a controlled and structured way. Postman is an effective tool for team collaboration and smooth integration because it also provides an extensive library of pre-built connections.\\n\\nWhat do you dislike about Postman?\\nAlthough Postman has many valuable features, a few things may be improved. The sporadic slowness or latency when navigating complicated API procedures or handling massive datasets is one element that some users find annoying. The performance of Postman may be impacted while handling multiple requests or large amounts of data, resulting in slower response times and sporadic delays. This may be especially apparent when conducting extensive API simulations or testing. A minor nuisance that may restrict possibilities for users who wish to continue with the accessible version of Postman is that several sophisticated features and functions are only accessible in the commercial edition of the software. Furthermore, although the user interface is typically user-friendly, new users could find the learning curve challenging.\\n\\nWhat problems is Postman solving and how is that benefiting you?\\nPostman is an invaluable tool that effectively addresses various API development and testing challenges, ultimately benefiting developers in numerous ways. One of the critical problems it solves is the time-consuming and manual nature of API testing. Previously, developers had to rely on custom code or multiple tools to test APIs, leading to a cumbersome and error-prone process. However, Postman revolutionised this process by providing a centralised platform for creating and executing automated tests. This significantly reduces the time and effort required for testing, enabling developers to identify bugs and issues early in the development cycle and ensuring a more reliable and efficient testing process.\\n\\nCollaboration and communication among team members are also significantly improved with Postman. Its built-in collaboration features allow developers to easily share APIs, test cases, and documentation with their colleagues. Real-time collaboration, comments on specific API requests, and the ability to share collections streamline teamwork and enhance overall project efficiency. By facilitating seamless collaboration, Postman helps teams work together more effectively, saving time and reducing misunderstandings.\\n\\nFurthermore, Postman simplifies API documentation, another common challenge for developers. With its intuitive interface and tools, developers can effortlessly generate comprehensive and up-to-date documentation for their APIs. This documentation includes request examples, response schemas, and usage guidelines, ensuring that APIs are well-documented and facilitating better understanding and adoption by other developers or external consumers. This saves valuable time and ensures that APIs are appropriately documented, enhancing overall API usability and reducing support and maintenance efforts.\\n\\nIn summary, Postman solves the problems of manual testing, collaboration hurdles, and documentation challenges, delivering numerous benefits to developers. By automating testing processes, facilitating collaboration, and simplifying documentation, Postman saves time, improves productivity, enhances team collaboration, and ensures the reliability and effectiveness of APIs. With its comprehensive features and user-friendly interface, Postman has become an indispensable tool for developers, empowering them to streamline their API development and testing workflows.\",\n",

As a technical analyst, I have found Postman to be an invaluable asset in my work tools.\\n\\nOne of the standout features of Postman is its simplicity when it comes to making API calls. The user interface is intuitive, making it easy to construct and send requests to APIs. With just a few clicks, I can specify the endpoint, set headers, add query parameters, and include request bodies. This streamlined process saves me valuable time and allows me to focus on other aspects of my development tasks.\\n\\nAnother aspect that I appreciate about Postman is its wide range of authentication options. Whether I need to use Basic Auth, OAuth, SAML, or Bearer Token, Postman provides the necessary tools to handle various authentication methods effortlessly. This flexibility is crucial when working with different APIs that may have different authentication requirements. It ensures that I can test and interact with APIs regardless of their authentication protocols.\\n\\nCollaboration is another area where Postman excels. The ability to share collections of APIs with team members and work on them collaboratively is a game-changer. Multiple users can access and make modifications to the same set of APIs, allowing for efficient teamwork and coordination. This feature promotes collaboration and simplifies the process of managing and maintaining API collections in a team environment\\n\\nWhat do you dislike about Postman?\\nFirstly, the interface can sometimes be overwhelming, especially for newcomers. There are many options and settings that can be configured, and it can be challenging to find the specific settings you need. Simplifying and organizing the interface would greatly enhance the user experience, particularly for beginners.\\n\\nAdditionally, working with variables in Postman can be somewhat challenging. While variables are a powerful feature for dynamic and reusable requests, their implementation in Postman could be more user-friendly. The process of saving data from response in variables is not always intuitive, and it can take some trial and error to get them working correctly. Improving the usability of variables would make them more accessible and increase their usefulness.\\n\\nWhat problems is Postman solving and how is that benefiting you?\\nPostman solves several problems that greatly benefit developers and API testers. Firstly, it provides a fast and efficient way to test APIs. With Postman, developers can easily construct and send API requests, including headers, parameters, and request bodies. This eliminates the need for manually writing code or using complex tools for testing APIs, saving time and effort.\\n\\nAdditionally, Postman offers a wide range of pre-developed tools and features specifically designed to work with APIs. These tools include the ability to handle different authentication methods, generate code snippets in multiple programming languages, and run automated tests on API endpoints. By providing these ready-to-use features, Postman simplifies the process of working with APIs and reduces the need for developers to build custom solutions from scratch.',\n",

It seems to be some syncing issue with our profile. If that were rectified, the app would be better. Providing Authorization parameters in the collection sometimes goes wrong. Suppose we are giving the token for a Collection and using the same authorisation param to be inherited for all the requests.

Through cURL it's easy to share the API with colleagues.\\n- The app is available to free users so no need to worry about paying before using or any limited trial version.

The thing which makes it unique is it allows one to create workspace and manage their testing more efficiently. It saves all the APIs run earlier and helps you to navigate between them more easily. The UI is also intuitive. I guess it supports all types of verbs available in calling web services starting from GET,POST .. to LINK, UNLINK. There is also support for a wide range of authentication mode for API test. Another unique feature to site is pre request script where one can write javascript which will be executed before the request is made. Data visualization for payload headers, body is also impressive. One can select data format of the payload and response and accordingly your data syntax will get highlighted for better readability. One more unique feature I came across lately is postman interceptor, a small chrome extension which allows user to use the cookies right from the chrome browser, so one need not to give auth details in case he/she is already logged into the application while testing the APIs.\\n\\nWhat do you dislike about Postman?\\nIts not a dislike but postman only supports REST API request , it would be better if SOAP calls can also be made through it. I guess there is no downside of this application.\\n\\nRecommendations to others considering Postman:\\nI would definitely  recommend POSTMAN to those who are building web services or in a learning phase or designing the architecture of a network based application. Its a great tool for testing purpose as well, to separately test individual modules and functionality of an application.\\n\\nWhat problems is Postman solving and how is that benefiting you?\\nCurrently I am working on developing APIs and web services, so clients like Postman is of immense help while testing the functionality before incorporating the web service into the application. It also helps to understand the APIs and responses when it comes to integrating any third party application.',\n",

It is very easy to set up an API call and it guides you through the possible fields that are in an API call.

Insomnia makes it easy to switch between environments, and lines up all of your API calls in a left hand pane, making it easy to switch between them since you can see their names. The top bar on Postman does get somewhat crowded if you have many requests saved. I also think it would be nice to see more color coding because it makes it easier to spot variables, inputs, input values. Perhaps a demo of how to use Postman would be useful to see when first downloaded.\\n\\nRecommendations to others considering Postman:\\nGood for using if you care about past requests and log of when you did those API calls.

I usually use Insomnia but work with a team that uses Postman so have been using it to understand how they do their API calls. One thing that Postman does better though is they save a history of calls on the left hand bar which is helpful if you want to refer to a date you were working on something in particular.

I stumbled across Postman and it was love at first sight. It helped me test API endpoints quickly (REST, SOAP, or GraphQL), generate cURLs, and save preset headers just to name a few of the many great features it offers. It is a simple and intuitive UI for developers to manage the stages of the API lifecycle and as my title states it saved me and my team's APIs.\\n\\nWhat do you dislike about Postman?\\nFor me, there is nothing to dislike. I love this tool, and for me, it has become a lifesaver. It is the best way for me as a developer to test an API and visualize how it works.\\nIf I had to nitpick, the latest update of Postman was a bit of an issue for my PC; I had to uninstall it and re-install it again.\\n\\nRecommendations to others considering Postman:\\nPostman is a potent tool and great for REST APIs; other kinds of services work well with Postman.\\n\\nWhat problems is Postman solving and how is that benefiting you?\\nPostman has haleped in the ability to test APIs, visualize how they work, and generate cURLs for the APIs. It helps a lot if you are trying to understand the APIs and do a quick test. Before I was using a tool made in-house to hit a couple of APIs, that tool was buggy, and it had limits. I cannot stress enough how Postman has become a great benefit. It has cut down on the time our team takes to test the APIs and it has become to the to go tool whenever we need to test APIs or have new APIs that we need to hit.\",\n",

Any newbie can use the device without much hustle. The Postman provides all necessary features like API testing, design, documentation, regression, collections, and so on, which makes the tool a one-stop solution to all the activities needed to be performed.\\n\\nWhat do you dislike about Postman?\\nThe collections for API testing don't allow the user to use API-specific certificates instead made available as a standard-setting. This makes it difficult to add and remove certs each time the API request is made. The integtrations with other tool can be made better and easier. Security testing can also be added as one of the features.\\n\\nRecommendations to others considering Postman:\\nPeople can blindly rely on this tool to perform all the activities regarding API like manual tests, regression tests, sanity tests, design, documentation. It's straightforward to use and provides excellent support and documentation for accessing the application. Also, the tool is free and can be downloaded quickly, and can be utilized without any limit.\\n\\nWhat problems is Postman solving and how is that benefiting you?\\nI'm able to test the APIs of the application by creating collections and also individually. I'm able to run regression tests for these collections and also make the APIs run at specific time intervals. It provides a clean test report for the time taken with the number of passes and fails tests, along with status codes and responses. The time saved is vast as the tool provides a one-stop solution.

A really good tool to have for all backend engineers!\\n\\nWhat problems is Postman solving and how is that benefiting you?\\nWith postman, I use it to help develop and test backend API's before connecting them with the front end of the application. This makes it extremely easy to test out code we're developing in real-time to ensure data that is received it the correct data that should be going to the front end.

During testing, we simply select GET, POST, or any other request type and give the data in the header or body. It will take a response from the server and give it to you. I have used postman for 6 months, I feel postman has lots of features that are not used by me but It is also very helpful for different applications.\\n\\nWhat do you dislike about Postman?\\npersonally, I don't have any features that are not helpful for me.

I developed API through the Django web framework. I want to test that API whether it is working well or not. If I am doing the test with a browser then It will take lots of time and It is a lengthy process. When I used postman then I can overcome this problem and doing a great job with minimal time and less complexity. The benefits are we can use lots of postman features along with testing API.

It is user friendly to test the request and response of Rest APIs using Postman. Also, it can be used for automating API testing. Additionally, the APIs tested by one can easily be exported and shared with a peer in the form of collections and once that is imported, all request response and other parameters get imported.\\n\\nWhat do you dislike about Postman?\\nThe Api automation feature of Postman is not user friendly and and full automation cannot be achieved in all cases. So the automation should be more flexible\\n\\nWhat problems is Postman solving and how is that benefiting you?\\nI am using Postman regularly in my organization for testing various Hybris APIs for my project. These APIs have various authentication like header, bearer token etc and all are supported by postman. Also, certificate authentication is supported in Postman.

It has a very handy and easy-to-use feature to generate mock APIs and API documentation. This makes it very easy to design APIs. It also has good features for creating collections and environments that can easily be used to call the same APIs in multiple different environments. Postman also has great features to translate API calls into curl requests which makes it very easy to generate requests that can be called through a command line instead of the Postman UI.\\n\\nWhat do you dislike about Postman?\\nI dislike that Postman sometimes has issues with SSL and VPNs. For example, when I am connected to a VPN, it does not always propagate through Postman, and the Postman connectivity fails to those endpoints.\\n\\nWhat problems is Postman solving and how is that benefiting you?\\nThe problems we are solving with Postman include being able to call APIs for testing and development. It has a useful UI that makes it very easy to construct API call requests and execute them in multiple different environments. You can also run tests in Postman which makes it very easy to test APIs easily in an automated fashion. The benefits include easy and fast development and testing for APIs.',\n",

The workspaces works great when it comes to switching to different projects for personal or organizations APIs.

Otherwise Its great overall product which is fast and provides all the features to make it easy and saves time and cost, which otherwise would eat lot of development time for the developers.\\n\\nRecommendations to others considering Postman:\\nIf you are looking for a API collaboration tools for your development tool which is easy to use and accessible using both GUI and Web and performs testing automation too, you should definitely checkout Postman. It has a great community and documentation with all the exciting feature releases and upgrades. A Tool which will help your teams improve productivity and collaborate both devs with testers. Highly recommended.\\n\\nWhat problems is Postman solving and how is that benefiting you?\\nWe build, test and deploy our API's using Postman. Our testers get help from the test cases and the overall experience that is provided by the Postman Interface is really helpful when it comes to managing large number of APIs and maintaining their changes or versioning them. The GUI works well with any OS, making life easier for developers and testers to test them by having full control over the API's history. Overall a great tool if you want to get rid of the cli.

Also they continually improve the software which is great.\\n\\nWhat do you dislike about Postman?\\nI do not like the fact that they discontinued the chrome webapp support.  Previously you could run it right on your chrome browser(which everybody uses it anyways, these days) As most of the apis run on the web, you could previously just quickly switch tabs and try it out on postman. Now it runs as a separate app. This is a bit of inconvenience as it runs in a separate window and takes more resources of your computer. I hope they bring back the native chrome webapp support in near future.\\n\\nRecommendations to others considering Postman:\\nAdopt it. It is the best API management app in the market.It supports all REST APIs including the latest HATEos architecture. Also the software  has a free plan so you have nothing to lose. There are no ads as well to distract you. They have a paid plan for $24 which is cheap in my opinion for an enterprise software.\\n\\nWhat problems is Postman solving and how is that benefiting you?\\nApi testing.

              "   'review_content': \"What do you like best about Postman?\\nThe single best feature for me is that the free version does everything I need as a developer. It allows me to easily generate test data to send to my own APIs for testing, allows me to easily make test requests to other APIs, and allows multiple easily configured environments for those tests. It also allows you to automatically run tests (some limitations here on the free version, but more than enough capability in my experience) that you've written. Postman also works with GraphQL, which is just a nice feature that isn't necessarily something everyone will need or use. I also feel like Postman has a wide variety of users, so it is often easy to find other use cases similar to what you need if you are unable to figure something out yourself.\\n\\nWhat do you dislike about Postman?\\nThe free version has some severe limitations in weird places, while being perfect in other limitations. An example is the number of calls that can be registered in a team workspace, 25 is just too low for a team of any size. This is one of those places where I feel like Postman really missed with the free version, because 90% of the rest of the free version limitations are all what I would consider reasonable and usable as is. And certainly if you exceed those other limitations, you should probably upgrade to a paid plan and support them, but in this case, 25 for a team is just too low in my opinion. It makes the team workspace almost not worth using unless you have a team of only 2 and a very limited API. The only other big negative is that you are more likely to find answers outside of Postman's official documentation and support pages than you are within their own documentation.\\n\\nWhat problems is Postman solving and how is that benefiting you?\\nI have used Postman in the past to test calls to API endpoints I'm building integrations. It not only helps to validate the url structure for https requests, but also lets you check out any issues with responses that you might be getting in an easier format. The main thing I currently use Postman for is to generate fake on-site event tracking data for my testing site as well as verifying the responses from my system.\",\n",

Postman also works with GraphQL, which is just a nice feature that isn't necessarily something everyone will need or use. I also feel like Postman has a wide variety of users, so it is often easy to find other use cases similar to what you need if you are unable to figure something out yourself.\"},\n",

              "     'answer': \"The free version has some severe limitations in weird places, while being perfect in other limitations. An example is the number of calls that can be registered in a team workspace, 25 is just too low for a team of any size. This is one of those places where I feel like Postman really missed with the free version, because 90% of the rest of the free version limitations are all what I would consider reasonable and usable as is. And certainly if you exceed those other limitations, you should probably upgrade to a paid plan and support them, but in this case, 25 for a team is just too low in my opinion. It makes the team workspace almost not worth using unless you have a team of only 2 and a very limited API. The only other big negative is that you are more likely to find answers outside of Postman's official documentation and support pages than you are within their own documentation.\"},\n",

It lets me easily invoke webservices with very little configuration to be done up front. The pre-test tab lets you to add scripts to dynamically construct API requests and you can validate the response from the API  using scripts under the tests tab which is a huge advantage with Postman. You can also share requests quite easily by the import wizard in Postman or share an entire workspace by itself.\\n\\nWhat do you dislike about Postman?\\nWhen using collections runner, you cannot include APIs or web services from multiple collections in your workspace. Also to note, only one data file can be specified in the collections runner window which is not really useful when you want to execute multiple apis with its own sets of data,\\nPostman console always opens up as a new window and cannot be docked into the main postman window. This is kind of difficult when you want to see trace console activity side-by-side when working on your main window.\\n\\nRecommendations to others considering Postman:\\nPostman is a must-have tool when working with micro-services today. Its highly intuitive interface to compose and run API requests means that you'll be up and running wit Postman in no time. Postman also lets you create dynamic web service requests and you can also write assertions on the response payload very easily. You can also create a Team workspace t share requests and even entire collections across your team boosting reusability of your API automation.\\n\\nWhat problems is Postman solving and how is that benefiting you?\\nA very simple, easy to understand user interface is the biggest benefit I have come across using postman. You can get started with very little set up and learning curve. I use Postman to trigger webservices, validate response and even perform some good level of automated testing. Postman allows creation of scripts which can be executed before triggering an API request as well as to assert on the response payload. This is particularly useful when you need  need to construct dynamic API requests by supplying parameters and to assert on the attributes from the response.

I have found that User Interface features that are cool are sometimes hidden behind the menu. It was inconvenient to find them and collaborate with them.

Things like auth tokens or environment variables if read from terminal, it would be a great add on for everyday purposes.\\n\\nRecommendations to others considering Postman:\\nIt's the one and only best option available in market for the use cases and it is building on that base and providing a set of tools and integration to make API development and maintenance a breeze. It will also, help improve save time on small tasks that we repeatedly do and teams will become more productive.\\n\\nWhat problems is Postman solving and how is that benefiting you?\\nWe mainly use Postman to construct requests to test our APIs. This has been very useful so far with the feature Postman supports as of now.\\n\\nWe also use postman for creating and sharing collections across teams for those who are dependent on our services. These collections helps us to have a set of test bed which we can trigger to test all the endpoints of the services or selected ones without writing the requests again and again.

Also, Postman is targeted to be used mostly in difficult situations so, for relatively simple requests, the restrictions can be overcrowded, and the overwhelming majority of the clients in our company just use the fundamentals of reasonable requests.\\n\\nRecommendations to others considering Postman:\\nI suggest Postman if your company is constantly in charge of managing and developing APIs. Postman is also a fantastic tool for teamwork, as you can also share requests for configuration with all your team members so that everyone can evaluate and monitor from everywhere.\\n\\nWhat problems is Postman solving and how is that benefiting you?\\nPostman is actually being used by our IT department to make API tests and to create and manage web apps. Before acquiring Postman, I researched a range of sophisticated tools and found out that Postman was the best suited for the most complex circumstances. We use it multiple times a week as we provide APIs to most of our clients, and Postman is the right tool to do that.

Also, it includes automation checks to track the features and the quality of your APIs. Postman is very good to create, store, import and export the entire idea of collections. It's very user-friendly as well. Checking the API gateway with Postman is really quick and we can submit anything we wish for to check in case of mistake.\\n\\nWhat do you dislike about Postman?\\nPostman may be a little confusing and cumbersome for new users, so you will need to take some time to practice. It may be frustrating to use the tabs on Postman as there are hundreds of tabs available and you may easily get confused. Also, it fails to integrate with 3rd party to track and submit reports.\\n\\nRecommendations to others considering Postman:\\nPostman is suitable in ordinary or business settings for checking and improving cloud service. Also, it will work well if you have to switch the experiments in different settings and structures. However, I would not recommend using Postman as a programming device or an optimization system, because it is specially built for developmental research and monitoring.\\n\\nWhat problems is Postman solving and how is that benefiting you?\\nPostman was deployed in the IT department of my company to build APIs and internet services on a daily basis.

The tool provides you with the perfect environment for Api development and testing.\\nThe robust features of the tool like saving Api collections, generating the collections from urls, saving the global variables etc. pave the way for a successful development and testing process.\\nIt is a great collaborative tool as well. If you make any changes to the Api and save the request, it becomes instantly visible to your team.\\nIt gives you the facility of checking the type of request you are sending or the content-type of the request, allows you to configure the request variables both from the body and the forms and a lot more.\\nOne of the features of the tool that makes it stand out is the ability to chain request and test data during Api testing. This gives a whole new dimension to your process of Api handling.\\n\\nWhat do you dislike about Postman?\\nSince the tool operates on such high complexity therefore it can sometime cause performance issues on a low end machine. this can make it a bit sluggish and slow.\\nSending multidimensional arrays can also become problem as you have to manually enter each level despite it having the same structure.\\n\\nRecommendations to others considering Postman:\\nThe tool is one of the best options out there. It takes your Api development and testing to you a new level.

Aside from that, the limit on the number of free calls seems like a lot (1000), until you use it up, which I have done on occasion when building APIs.\\n\\nRecommendations to others considering Postman:\\nGet it. Postman doesn't disappoint. And its free! Whats not to love?\\n\\nWhat problems is Postman solving and how is that benefiting you?\\nPostman allows easy testing of APIs, either to test functionality of an API you plan on using, or to test one that you are building yourself. Having the ability to quickly and easily send and receive messages, and inspect them also, has been a game changer.
